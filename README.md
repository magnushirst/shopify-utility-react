# Shopify Website Utility

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilise the Shopify APIs to perform actions not available via the Shopify dashboard
and that don't require to be hosted 24/7. When working with Shopify, I noticed that metafields are not easy to access 
modify without the use of apps which often require a paid subscription. This is also a way for me to learn some new 
technologies and understand how Shopify works. If you are conscious of app developers having access to your store, customer
or order data, this is also a great way to keep everything local on your machine.

I will try to make features as generalised as possible so that it isn't tied to one particular store which I added 
features like the filter syncing shown below. If you have any suggestions of features you'd like to see, please get in
touch.
